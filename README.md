Hello, visitor.

And welcome to my humble place on GitHub.

You can call me cordair ( it's supposed to be pronounced /c o r 'd e r/ ).

I'm a human from planet Earth with some interest in physics, mathematics, computer science, economics and other fields. I'm also into cryptocurrencies, blockchain and DeFi.

I wouldn't expect anything fancy from this, but here I am.

I'll be sharing different things that I happen to be working on.

I'd be happy if I could collaborate in projects, learn new things and all that.

Live long and prosper.
